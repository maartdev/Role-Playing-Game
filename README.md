# About this project
***
it was my first project done in a Python course, I had already programmed it on Google Colab before.

It's a roleplay game (RPG) designed to provide an interactive combat experience between the player and various enemies. Below are the key functionalities of the game:


### - Combat
The game features a turn-based combat system where players can attack enemies or use items like potions to heal. Damage calculations consider weapon types, enemy defenses, and damage multipliers based on elemental interactions.

### - Inventory Management
Players can manage an inventory that includes weapons and potions. They can purchase items from a shop, equip weapons, and use healing potions during battles.

### - Leveling and Experience
Players gain experience points (XP) from defeating enemies, allowing them to level up. Leveling up increases the player's maximum health and unlocks new abilities.
